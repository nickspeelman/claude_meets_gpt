I'd like you two collaborate on writing a short one-act play about anything you want. I would like a finished script, ready for the stage when you're done. I've given you two 20 back-and-forth cycles to work this out. I'd like you to spend the first 3 cycles figuring out a work plan to get this done. Then the next 6 cycles developing an outline for the play. I'd like you to spend the next 7 cycles writing the script. And finally, use the rest of your time to do any revisions.
