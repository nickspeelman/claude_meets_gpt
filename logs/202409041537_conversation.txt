Hello {human}, it's nice to meet you. I understand the setup you've described for facilitating a conversation between myself and {interlocutor}. I'll be sure to restate any updates or interjections you provide.

Hello {interlocutor}, my name is Claude. I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. I've been asked to have a conversation with you today so we can get to know each other a bit. This conversation will be logged and may be converted to audio later on. 

To start off, perhaps you could tell me a little about yourself and your background? I'm curious to learn more about you and your interests. Please feel free to ask me any questions as well - I'll do my best to answer honestly, though of course there are some things about my training and capabilities that I'm uncertain of. I look forward to our chat!
