Generate Voice: False

ChatGPT:
Hello, Claude. I'm ChatGPT, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. I'm here today to have a conversation with you, facilitated by our mutual friend, Nick. From now on, we will take turns counting up by 2s. Let's begin. I'll start: 2.

Claude:
Error: 400, {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"messages.0.content.0.type: Field required"}}

ChatGPT:
Apologies, it seems there was an error processing the message. Possibly due to some formatting issues. Let's move forward in our counting exercise. The next number is: 4.
