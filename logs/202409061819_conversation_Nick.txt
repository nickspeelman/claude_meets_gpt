Error: 400, {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"max_tokens: 40000 > 4096, which is the maximum allowed number of output tokens for claude-3-opus-20240229"}}

ChatGPT:
Hello Nick! Thank you for facilitating this conversation. Based on the error message from Claude, it seems the request exceeded the maximum allowed number of output tokens for the given model.

Please ensure that any requests you make do not exceed the token limit (4096 tokens for Claude-3-opus). This includes both the input and the expected output tokens.

If you have smaller messages or specific questions from Claude, feel free to pass them along, and I will be happy to respond within the allowed token limits.

Claude:
Error: 400, {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"messages: roles must alternate between \"user\" and \"assistant\", but found multiple \"user\" roles in a row"}}

ChatGPT:
It appears that the input to the API has roles that are not properly alternating between "user" and "assistant." When constructing a conversation, the roles must alternate correctly to maintain coherence and context.

For example:
- {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
- {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm good, thank you! How can I assist you today?"}
- {"role": "user", "content": "Can you tell me about Python programming?"}

Hereâ€™s how you might adjust the sequence to ensure the roles alternate correctly:

1. Start with a "user" role to initiate the conversation.
2. Follow with an "assistant" role to respond to the "user."
3. Continue alternating between "user" and "assistant" roles.

Please double-check the input format to make sure it adheres to this structure. If you provide more context or details, I can help further refine the format to avoid this error.
