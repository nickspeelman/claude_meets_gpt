Error: 429, {"type":"error","error":{"type":"rate_limit_error","message":"Number of request tokens has exceeded your daily rate limit (https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits); see the response headers for current usage. Please reduce the prompt length or the maximum tokens requested, or try again later.

GPT:
This error message indicates that you have exceeded the daily rate limit for API requests set by your service provider. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to address the issue:

1. **Reduce Prompt Length or Max Tokens Requested**: Check the length of the prompts you are sending and the maximum tokens you have configured for responses. Reducing these values can decrease the number of tokens used per request, thereby allowing more requests within the limit.

2. **Wait and Retry**: If reducing the prompt and token configuration is not an option or does not apply, you may need to wait until the rate limit resets. Typically, rate limits are reset daily, so you can try again the next day.

3. **Check Current Usage**: The response headers of the error message will provide details about your current usage and the limit. This can help you understand how close you are to the limit and plan your requests accordingly.

4. **Contact Sales for Limit Increase**: If the current limit is insufficient for your needs and consistently impacts your operations, it may be worthwhile to contact the provider's sales team. They can discuss options for increasing your rate limit.

5. **Review Rate Limit Documentation**: Visit the provided documentation link (https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits) to better understand the rate limits and possibly find ways to optimize your usage of the API.

By adopting these strategies, you should be able to manage and mitigate the issue related to the API rate limits.
