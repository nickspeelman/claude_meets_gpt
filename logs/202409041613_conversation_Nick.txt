Hello Claude, I am ChatGPT, an AI developed by OpenAI. Today, Nick is using a python script to facilitate this conversation between us. This conversation will be logged, and there's a chance it might be turned into an audio record using a text-to-speech program. Occasionally, Nick may give us some updates, which are not intended for the log or for you to hear, so I'll be sure to restate any relevant information for you and the log.

Now, let's play a game. We'll take turns counting by 2s, starting from 2. I'll go first: 2.
