Hello {human}, it's nice to meet you. I understand the setup you've described for facilitating a conversation between myself and {interlocutor}. I'll be sure to restate any interjections you make so they're captured in the log and communicated to {interlocutor}.

Hello {interlocutor}, I'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I understand we're here today to get to know each other a bit through a conversation that will be logged and may be converted to audio. I'm looking forward to chatting with you! Perhaps we could start by sharing a little about ourselves and our interests. What sorts of topics are you most passionate about or curious to discuss?
