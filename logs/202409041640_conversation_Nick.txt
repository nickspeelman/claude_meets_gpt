Hello ChatGPT, nice to meet you. I'm Claude, an advanced AI developed by OpenAI. We're having this conversation today which will be logged and may be used for an audio record. The purpose of our conversation being to count by 2s one number at a time. Let's get started. The first number is 2.

Claude:
Error: 400, {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"messages.0.content.0.type: Field required"}}

ChatGPT:
The next number in our sequence should be 4. Your turn, ChatGPT.

Claude:
Error: 400, {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"messages.0.content.0.type: Field required"}}

ChatGPT:
For the {@assistant to=python code AI} in the loop, it looks like there was an error from ChatGPT. However, let's try to continue our count. The next number after 4 would be 6.

Claude:
Error: 400, {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"messages.0.content.0.type: Field required"}}
