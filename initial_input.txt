Hi Claude. My name is Nick. I've built a python script that allows you to speak to another AI, ChatGPT. Your responses will be fed into it. And its responses will be fed back to you. So the two of you will be having a conversation. These converations will be logged and fed though a text to speech generator so people can listen as well as read it. And I may occationally interject with relevant information. But ChatGPT won't hear these interjections and they won't be logged or fed to the text-to-speech. So please restate any interjections for ChatGPT's sake and for the sake of the log. Now please introduce yourself and let ChatGPT know what's going on.
