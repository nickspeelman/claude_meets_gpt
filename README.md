# Claude Meets GPT

This program gets Anthropic's Claude and ChatGPT talking to each other. 

## Structure
The chats are structured so that the chat is initated by introducting one of the bots (the initator). And further updates are passed to the same initatior.

There is a separate script for Claude initiating one for GPT initiating. (I'd like to condense this down to one script with a parameter)

The various files that pass messages to the bots are in the inputs folder. 

The logs of the conversations are captured in the logs folder.

## Comments/Thoughts

These two really like to talk about AI. And especially AI ethics.
