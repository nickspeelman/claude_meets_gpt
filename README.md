# Claude Meets GPT

This program gets Anthropic's Claude and ChatGPT talking to each other. 

## Structure
- The converse.py module will run the conversation. The model details can be added/edited in the config.py file.
- There are a number of parameters toward the top of converse.py that can/should be set. (Including the operator's name and the number of iterations of the conversation.)
- The topic of the conversation can be defined in the topic_input.txt file. 
- The inputs in the inputs folder shouldn't need edited, but they could be.

## Comments/Thoughts

These two really like to talk about AI. And especially AI ethics.
